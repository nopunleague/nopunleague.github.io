The NPL season is well underway, with no shortage of excitement. 
Joe's continued disregard for the sanctity of the sacko punishment came to a culmination of threatening score correction violence today, but luckily he has redeemed himself by providing a suggestion for our first installment of *NPL Next-gen Stats* (fuck you Goodell I'm infringing this copyright). 
The idea is to see which team managers are most adept at picking each position, based on their average score for each position for the first 9 weeks of the season. 
Of course this will be biased towards which team drafted the best players at each position, but it may be particularly insightful for the more *chaos-prone* positions requiring heightened manager savvy (or luck?).
This analysis completely ignores players on your bench (since they did not score you any points) and your flex starters are lumped in with their actual position under the guise that you possess some kind of savvy for coaching certain positions. 
The numbers next to your team name are your average point scored per player at that position.
