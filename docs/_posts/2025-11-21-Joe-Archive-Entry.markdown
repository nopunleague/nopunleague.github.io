The great Wolfgang Mozart once said, "better late than never, but damn my good bitch that was late as fuck", and of course he was talking about Joe finally fulfilling his Sacko punishment from last season (under duress of punishment).
I invite the esteemed members of the NPL to visit the [Sacko archives]({% link archive.markdown %}) and relive the glory of this punishment at your leisure.
