The time is nearly upon us that NPL members eagerly await all year.
Where we will find who has make the nice list (AKA playoff bracket), and who has made the naughty list (Sacko). 
Whomst among us is competently managing their fantasy roster and whomst is best player is their kicker Brandon Aubrey? 
The day of reckoning to answer these questions is upon us. 

# Championship Preview
This is an eagerly anticipated championship matchup between Nakua Matata and ChristianMcmingle.com. 
Troy's team is coming off a high scoring regular season and the first ever 200 point performance in NPL history (this has not been fact checked but I'm pretty sure). 
Brad's squad also showed strong potential throughout the regular season, including handing Matata their only regular season loss in Week 3.
The advantage in this matchup appears to be split with RBs towards McMingle and WRs towards Matata. 
Both teams are led by their namesakes being number one on the season at their position. 
Additionally, Matata has two more of the top 5 WRs on their roster what the fuck? 
McMingle has struggled to find a good number 2 RB to complement McCaffrey, but they have benefited from a strong roster at all other positions.

Conversely, Matata found good scoring from Judkins at times during the season but have not gotten much going at RB besides him and occasional good performances from Chase Brown. 
This is not for lack of effort, as observing the free agent activity any given week will reveal Troy cycling through running backs like they are White House Press Secretaries. 
Unfortunately the bench full of RBs has turned out to bear further resemblance to this analogy where I guess the bench is collection of racist podcasters. 
Nonetheless, this roster has had no problems scoring all season and we should expect this to continue in the championship game. 
Many of the Matatas also have favorable matchups with opposing defenses this week that should also boost their output. 

The depth of McMingle means that Brad has some tougher choices ahead of setting his championship lineup. 
Both QBs on roster look like good options. Although Herbert is having the slightly better season, perhaps Baker has the better matchup this week? 
In the single week playoff format this roster depth is less valuable than it would be in the two week format but still leaves the manager some additional control.
There are some interesting implications for this fantasy matchup based on whether or not Davante plays this week. 
Not only so that McMingle can get a solid boost at WR scoring but also for the implications on target share for Nakua. 
As of the writing of this post, Adams was unlikely to play but they have a long week before MNF and get to see how other NFC games turn out and decide if it is worth it. 


Overall, the lizard projection is giving a slight edge to Matata which feels pretty accurate at the moment. 
However this is not a comfortable lead by any means and this championship matchup could easily go either way. 

# Sacko Preview 
The season long Sacko favorites, Half Chubb, have found themselves in the final battle to avoid bowling misery against the down-on-their-luck Stinky Red Dog's who have ended up in the Sacko after narrowly missing the playoffs. 
The Stinky roster is much better across the board, but there are some NFL matchups that could make this game closer than expected. 
Lizard projection gives a very slight edge to the Stinky Red Dogs but Half Chubb is still holding out hope because of how close the projections are. 

This seems like a good time to revisit the expected vs actual wins (schedule luck/fantasy defense) and projection vs actual points analyses for the rest of the season.
