Congratulations to everyone on another NPL season, and especially our championship team the Nakua Matata's. 
To reminisce on this past NPL season and previous ones, this post contains some scoring summary statistics from the history of the current NPL ESPN instance, i.e. 2021-present. 
Additionally, we have Sacko Punishment Preview feature at the end of this article. 
If you don't care about scoring stats but do care about Latto bowling scroll to the end of this post. 

# NPL scoring history from 2021 to 2025
First, we will look at the highest and lowest scoring individual weeks.
This analysis is seeking to address whether Troy 2025 and Latto 2025 are amongst the best and worst NPL teams, respectively, ever assembled.

One note about all of the scoring stats here is that we have to omit the championship weeks (15-16) from 2021 because we played a two week match that year. 
ESPN just lumps these together into a single score and it would throw everything off, so those two weeks are unfortunately omitted from everything shown here.

# Sacko Preview
Well we all knew this day was coming but it is now official, Team Half Chubb is your 2025 Sacko loser and will suffer the new bowling scoring punishment. 
This appropriately named squad brought some of the weakest performances in NPL history and lost hope fairly early in the season despite no shortage of bottom feeders to contend with this season. 
Nonetheless, Latto will be forced to enter a bowling alley and can't leave until he has scored 2041 points. 
He will be aided in this endeavor by a 50 point allocation for each beer he finishes during the bowling matches. 
We are all familiar with Latto's beer-drinking player profile, but maybe not so much for bowling. 
Not only am I your esteemed NPL commissioner, but also the foremost investigative journalist and beat reporter. 
Therefore, I have compiled for you below a complete bowler profile for Sam Latto so that you can join us in eagerly anticipating this painful event.

![latto pic]({{ site.url }}/media/lattopic.png)
| Name | Nickname | Shoe Size | Preferred Ball Weight | Favorite Bowling Snack |
|-----:|---------:|----------:|----------------------:|-----------------------:|
| Sam Latto | Gattica | 11.5 (Mens) | 10 lbs | Famous Dave's, Light Beer (Tie) |

The question on everyone's minds is, "how many games will this actually take?" and more importantly, "How will he balance the beers and pins?" that stand between young Latto and freedom. 
There isn't much data available to predict his typical scores, but we were able to find some first hand qualitative sources. 
> "He bowls 80 on a good day" - John Barker, occasional bowling opponent and former Detroit resident 

Yikes, I fucking hate bowling and also suck at it but 80 on a good day is not a very encouraging prediction to conquer this punishment. 
Luckily Latto can approach this the same as any other challenge that he might encounter in life and compensate by pounding down some cold ones at a professional level. 
One thing is for certain, this Sacko will soon reside appropriately amongst the esteemed annals of NPL misery.
