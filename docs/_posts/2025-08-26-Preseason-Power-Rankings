As we enter the 2025-2026 No Pun League season, I think I speak for us all when I say my heart is full of hope and my bladder full of hot piss. 
To get back into the state of mind for fantasy football season, I present to you the first ever No Pun League power rankings (Pre-Season Edition).
You might notice they look shockingly similar to the final rankings from last season. 
Well, that is because none of you did jack shit in the offseason. 

# 1. Is She A Waterpark?
## Managed By: Al Newell 
The reigning champs promise to come back strong for next season, although most will agree that we expect them to regress this year.
Finishing last season 10-4 with a league leading +15.7 scoring differential, you can count on Coach Chad to make a splash again this year with 
consistently high scoring. 
There is one question though, will he learn from his mistakes or will he draft Kyle Pitts again?

# 2. Hot Piss Powered Locomotives
## Managed By: Matt Dodd
With the second lowest scoring differential in the league (-13.4) and only a 7-7 regular season record, the HPPLs barely even squeaked 
into the playoffs. 
But you all know what happened next, the piss started boiling at the right time all the way to the championship game. 
Will they return to form next year and perhaps put together a better regular season? Probably not, but honestly maybe, it just depends.

# 3. Etiennes mis bolas en tu boca
## Managed By: Troy Van De Voort
Finishing number 1 in points scored (2045.88) and with a 9-5 record, the Bocas were the favorite to meet there slippery
nemesis in the championship. 
However, they ran into an unstoppable wave of supercritical piss in the semifinals. 
Perennially near the top of the leaderboard, and by far the most active free agent team, expect the Bocas near the top again next year.
Although, there are whisperings of a potential change to the free agent process for next year... 
Will this throw off Troy's mojo or only add to his power? 

# 4. Cee Deez Nuts
## Managed By: Sam Latto
Grandpa Sam put on a strong showing, as usual, but just didn't have the firepower to handle the waterpark in the semifinals. 
Although some are questioning if he is now a closeted michigan fan (known CHEATERS and pussies) and if that will impact his general
football-related judgement. 
Nonetheless, you can count on Ceeing Deez Nuts in the playoffs again next year.

# 5. Team Idlas Idlas
## Managed By: Steve Idlas
The only "Team Last Name" to make the playoffs, I wonder if the lack of team names correlates with their dedication to 
their management responsibilities? Well at least Steve put his name in twice for some reason and that seemed to make the 
difference. Team Idlas Idlas was also found in the group of 3 highest scoring teams but ended up underperforming in the playoffs
compared to the regular season. An unfortunate tie break scenario found him squarely in the path of the hot piss locomotive in the first round.
As another perennial contender, expect to find Steve in the playoffs again this year. 

# 6. Stinky Red Dogs
## Managed By: Abby Dodd 
Will the fact that this team's mascot is throwing a temper tantrum begging for his dinner next to me impact my forecast for their season?
Honestly, it will have a subliminal impact at minimum. Not now Red, dad's writing his fantasy football blog. 
These dogs hung around later in the season than expected after a rough start and close call with missing the playoffs. 
Early reports from the NPL Member Referendum are indicating that there is likely to be a change in this year's 
sacko punishment. Will a less terrifying punishment diminish this managers motivation on the season?

# 7. She Gibbs Good Head
## Managed By: Chris Weinberger
Coach Lucy has made strong runs in the NPL post-season in the past, but last year was a different story. 
At least he appears to have won the consolation bracket, scoring almost 190 points in week 17? That is the best I got.
Hopefully he can at least draft some players with more punnable names and gaurantee some improvement in his team name
next year. 

# 8. Team Sternig
## Managed By: Brad Sternig
Now we start a run in the standings that I am calling "the no name bottom feeders". 
Perhaps that moniker is a bit harsh considering they were all within a game or two of making the playoffs, and 
have all had better seasons in the past. 
Expect Brad to rebound this year, even if he can't seem to come up with a single team name after all these years, at 
least he can come up with some solid drafts from time to time and could easily appear in the playoff mix and no one would be surprised. 

# 9. Team Schwan 
## Managed By: Eric Schwan 
Last year was not Team Schwan's best season but also not his worst unfortunately. 
It would be surprising if Schwan changes up from his usual strategy of drafting the starting QB for the Green Bay Packers without fail. 
However this just might be one of the years that the strategy pays off, as most people agree J-Love is a lock for MVP in both regular season and super bowl. 

# 10. Team Powers
## Managed By: Matt Tripp (Previously Cory Flowers)
Team Ori made the very SHORTSIGHTED and BAD decision to relocate his headquarters to Ireland this season (low IQ). 
This act will not go unpunished by your VENGEFUL but FAIR commissioner. 
We welcome Matt Tripp as the new manager of Team Powers and expect to see MANY GREAT THINGS from him this season.
I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT.

# 11. Team Grasse
## Managed By: Kevin Grasse 
Like the Grasseman, the NPL giveth and the NPL taketh away. 
Last year Team Grasse got a little more on the taketh side. 
Such is the fickle nature of the NPL. 
Team Grasse at least did well to put away the sacko in week 16, despite a procedural misunderstanding and scare in the last few games. 
I honestly don't know what else to say about the second worst team in the league.
Better luck this year? 
I see why these ESPN guys have basically given up on original thoughts and just use chat gpt for everything now.

# 12. That's What Cheesehead 
## Managed By: Joe Gantenbein 
Well, you have to give it to the Cheeseheads, they left little doubt on who was the sacko favorite last year. 
Despite a close finish to escape the dreaded stand up comedy punishment, Joe will fall victim to probably the most dreaded punishment in NPL history (which is yet to be completed at the time of writing...). 
But don't expect the Ramblr to just lie down and take it again this year. 
He is a former NPL champion after all.
